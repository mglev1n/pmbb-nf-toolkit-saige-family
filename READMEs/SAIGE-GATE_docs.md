## Software Requirements


* [Nextflow version 24.04.3](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html)

* [Singularity 3.8.3](https://sylabs.io/docs/) OR [Docker 4.30.0](https://docs.docker.com/)
## Commands for Running the Workflow


* Singularity Command: `singularity build saige.sif docker://pennbiobank/saige:latest`

* Docker Command: `docker pull pennbiobank/saige:latest`

* Pull from Google Container Registry: `docker pull gcr.io/verma-pmbb-codeworks-psom-bf87/saige:latest`

* Run Command: `nextflow run /path/to/toolkit/module/workflows/saige_gwas.nf`

* Common `nextflow run` flags:

    * `-resume` flag picks up workflow where it left off

    * `-stub` performs a dry run, checks channels without executing code

    * `-profile` selects the compute profiles in nextflow.config

    * `-profile standard` uses the Docker image to execute processes

    * `-profile cluster` uses the Singularity container and submits processes to a queue

    * `-profile all_of_us` uses the Docker image on All of Us Workbench

* More info: [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html)
# Detailed Pipeline Steps

## Part I: Setup


1. Start your own tools directory and go there. You may do this in your project analysis directory, but it often makes sense to clone into a general `tools` location

```sh
# Make a directory to clone the pipeline into
TOOLS_DIR="/path/to/tools/directory"
mkdir $TOOLS_DIR
cd $TOOLS_DIR
```

2. Download the source code by cloning from git

```sh
git clone None
cd $TOOLS_DIR/pmbb-nf-toolkit-saige-family
```

3. Build the singularity image
    - you may call the image whatever you like, and store it wherever you like. Just make sure you specify the name in `nextflow.conf`
    - this does NOT have to be done for every saige-based analysis, but it is good practice to re-build every so often as we update regularly.


```sh
cd $TOOLS_DIR/pmbb-nf-toolkit-saige-family
singularity build saige.sif docker://pennbiobank/saige:latest
```
## Part II: Configure your run


1. Make a separate analysis/run/working directory.
    - The quickest way to get started, is to run the analysis in the folder the pipeline is run. However, subsequent analyses will over-write results from previous analyses.
    - ❗This step is optional, but We Highly recommend making a `tools` directory separate from your `run` directory. We recommend storing the `nextflow.conf` in here as it shouldn't change between runs.


```sh
WDIR="/path/to/analysis/run1"
mkdir -p $WDIR
cd $WDIR
```

2. Fill out the `nextflow.config` file for your system.
    - See [Nextflow configuration documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) for information on how to configure this file. An example can be found on our GitHub: [Nextflow Config](https://github.com/PMBB-Informatics-and-Genomics/pmbb-geno-pheno-toolkit/blob/main/Example_Configs/nextflow.config).
    - ❗IMPORTANTLY, you must configure a user-defined profile for your run environments (local, docker, saige, cluster, etc.). If multiple profiles are specified, run with a specific profile using `nextflow run -profile $MY_PROFILE`.
    - For singularity, The profile's attribute `process.container` should be set to `'/path/to/saige.sif'` (replace `/path/to` with the location where you built the image above). See [Nextflow Executor Information](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html) for more details.
    - ⚠️As this file remains mostly unchanged for your system, We recommend storing this file in the `tools/pipeline` directory and passing it to the pipeline with `-c /path/to/nextflow.config`.


3. Create a pipeline-specific `.config` file specifying your run parameters and input files. See Below for workflow-specific parameters and what they mean.
    - Everything in here can be configured in `nextflow.config`, however we find it easier to separate the system-level profiles from the individual run parameters.
    - Examples can be found in our Pipeline-Specific [Example Config Files](https://github.com/PMBB-Informatics-and-Genomics/pmbb-geno-pheno-toolkit/tree/main/Example_Configs).
    - you can compartamentalize your config file as much as you like by passing
    - There are 2 ways to specify the config file during a run:

        - with the `-c` option on the command line: `nextflow run -c SAIGE_FAMILY/configs/saige_gate.config`
        - in the `nextflow.config`: at the top of the file add: `includeConfig SAIGE_FAMILY/configs/saige_gate.config`

## Part III: Run your analysis


❗We HIGHLY recommend doing a STUB run to test the analysis using the `-stub` flag. This is a dry run to make sure your environment, parameters, and input_files are specified and formatted correctly.❗We also HIGHLY recommend doing a TEST run with the included test data in `$TOOLS_DIR/pmbb-nf-toolkit-saige-family/test_data`we have several pre-configured analyses runs with input data and fully-specified config files.

```sh
# run an exwas stub
nextflow run $TOOLS_DIR/pmbb-nf-toolkit-saige-family/workflows/saige_gwas.nf \
   -profile cluster \
   -c /path/to/nextflow.config \
   -c SAIGE_FAMILY/configs/saige_gate.config \
   -stub

# run an exwas for real
nextflow run $TOOLS_DIR/pmbb-nf-toolkit-saige-family/workflows/saige_gwas.nf \
   -profile cluster \
   -c /path/to/nextflow.config \
   -c SAIGE_FAMILY/configs/saige_gate.config

# resume an exwas run if it was interrupted or ran into an error
nextflow run $TOOLS_DIR/pmbb-nf-toolkit-saige-family/workflows/saige_gwas.nf \
   -profile cluster \
   -c /path/to/nextflow.config \
   -c SAIGE_FAMILY/configs/saige_gate.config \
   -resume
```
